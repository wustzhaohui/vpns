On the other hand, we can‚Äôt detect how many devices are using one subscription simultaneously. In order to prevent hundreds of users using one subscription, we can only limit the device number to 2. Our anti-device number checking technology is still developing and we believe that there will be more subscription options coming out soon. Thank you very much for your understanding.</p><p>For more information about account settings, please refer to the article <a href='/help/en/article/50' class='text-blue-600 hover:underline'>&lt;Use one subscription on multiple devices&gt;</a>.</p><p>If you encounter any problem while using LetsVPN, don't hesitate to email us at <a href='mailto:letsvpn@rbox.me' class='text-blue-600 hover:underline'>letsvpn@rbox.me</a>.
