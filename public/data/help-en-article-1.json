This is determined by your network hardware conditions and the objective environment.</p><p><b>Here are some common suggestions to improve download speed:</b></p><ul><li>Try switching to different download sources.</li><li>Download during off-peak hours.</li><li>If possible, upgrade your home network bandwidth.</li><li>Disconnect and reconnect in LetsVPN to get a new optimal node.</li></ul>"
