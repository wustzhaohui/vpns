However, some of you might have different situations relating to device/account remaining time. Here are detailed explanations.</p><h2>Registering/Log into your account on device</h2><ol style='list-style-type: decimal; padding-left: 2rem; margin: 1rem 0;'><li>If you have purchased our service, the remaining time of your device (both paid and complimentary) will be automatically transferred to your account.</li><li>If the remaining time of your device is complimentary, then it won't be able to be transferred to your account.</li></ol><p>We made this rule to protect the system against hackers. Sorry for the inconvenience occurred and thank you very much for your understanding.</p><h2>Subscription tiers differ in account and device</h2><p>If the subscription level in your account is different from that of your device, you will enjoy the highest level of our service.</p><p>For example, if your account is Platinum level, which will be expired in 30 days, but your device is bronze level, which will be expired in 10 days, then you will enjoy Platinum subscription and it will be expired in 40 days.</p><h2>Remove one device from your account</h2><p>The status of removed device will be shown as ‚Äúexpired‚Äù even though there is still remaining time in your account.</p><p>If your device has been removed by people who share one account with you, please read <a href='#' class='text-blue-600 hover:underline'>&lt;Recover my LetsVPN account&gt;</a> and follow the instructions. Sharing your account with different users is in violation of LetsVPN Terms of Service. Nevertheless, we will try our best to help you if something unexpected happens.</p><h2>Sign out of the account</h2><p>You can sign out of your account only when there is one device in your account. After signing out, your remaining time will be transferred to your current device.</p><p>When there are two devices in your account, you can't sign out. You can remove one of the devices and nothing else will be affected.</p><p>For more details, please read <a href='/help/en/article/50' class='text-blue-600 hover:underline'>&lt;Use one subscription on multiple devices&gt;</a>.</p><p>If you encounter any problem while using LetsVPN, don't hesitate to email us at <a href='mailto:letsvpn@rbox.me' class='text-blue-600 hover:underline'>letsvpn@rbox.me</a>.
