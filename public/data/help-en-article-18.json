It plays a crucial role within the system, as many Windows applications, such as Lets VPN, rely on the .NET Framework to function properly.</p><img src='/assets/use-netfrenwork-en-1.png' alt='.NET Framework Logo' /><h2 style='margin-top:2rem;'>Why Does Lets VPN Depend on .NET Framework?</h2><p>The Windows version of Lets VPN is developed using C# technology, requiring .NET Framework as its foundational runtime environment. This framework provides essential support for stable application performance, including deep system compatibility, network communication handling, and interface rendering. If issues arise with .NET Framework, Lets VPN will be unable to function properly.</p><h2 style='margin-top:2rem;'>Scenarios When .NET Framework Fails to Run</h2><h3>Scenario 1: Error During Lets VPN Installation</h3><p>During the installation process of Lets VPN, the software will automatically attempt to update and verify the integrity of .NET Framework to ensure it is in a usable state. If the verification fails, an error message will be displayed, halting the installation process. The error prompt appears as follows:</p><img src='/assets/use-netfrenwork-en-2.png' alt='LetsVPN Installation Error Prompt' /><h3>Scenario 2: Lets VPN Fails to Respond on Startup</h3><p>Occasionally, due to Windows system updates or other factors, .NET Framework may become unintentionally corrupted. In this situation, even if Lets VPN has been successfully installed, it may fail to start properly because of issues with .NET Framework.</p><img src='/assets/use-netfrenwork-en-3.png' alt='Lets VPN fails to respond on startup' /><h2 style='margin-top:2rem;'>How to Fix .NET Framework Failure Issues?</h2><p>If issues arise with .NET Framework, try the following three methods to repair it:</p><h3>Method 1: Manually Update .NET Framework to the Latest Version</h3><p>Manually check for and install the latest version of .NET Framework to repair any potential corruption issues and ensure its proper functionality. Follow these steps:</p><ol><li><b>Open Command Prompt:</b><br/>Press <b>Windows + R</b> keys, type <code>cmd</code>, and then press <b>Enter</b>.</li><li><b>Enter the following command to check the .NET Framework version:</b><br/><code style='background-color:#f0f0f0; padding: 2px 5px; border-radius:3px; font-family:monospace;'>reg query \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\NET Framework Setup\\NDP\\v4\\Full\" /v Version</code></li><li><b>Check the output to confirm the current version (the latest version is 4.8.1).</b><ul><li>If the version is lower than 4.8.0, please refer to the next steps for updates.</li><li>If it is already version 4.8.0 or 4.8.1, please refer to other methods.</li></ul></li></ol><img src='/assets/use-netfrenwork-en-4.png' alt='CMD showing .NET Framework version' /><ol start='4'><li><b>Visit the Microsoft .NET Framework download page in your browser:</b><ul><li><a href='https://dotnet.microsoft.com/zh-cn/download/dotnet-framework/net48' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='text-blue-600 hover:underline'>Download .NET Framework 4.8.0 | Free official downloads</a></li><li><a href='https://dotnet.microsoft.com/zh-cn/download/dotnet-framework/net481' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='text-blue-600 hover:underline'>Download .NET Framework 4.8.1 | Free official downloads</a></li></ul></li><li><b>Click Download .NET Framework Runtime and install it manually.</b><ul><li>Due to system compatibility issues, it is recommended that you first install version 4.8.0.</li><li>If the problem is still not solved, you can try to upgrade to version 4.8.1.</li></ul></li><li><b>After a successful installation, restart your computer and check if Lets VPN runs correctly.</b></li></ol><img src='/assets/use-netfrenwork-en-5.png' alt='Download .NET Framework page' /><h3>Method 2: Repair .NET Framework Using the System Command <code>sfc /scannow</code></h3><p>The <code>sfc /scannow</code> command is a built-in Windows system repair tool that can safely scan and automatically fix corrupted system files, including those related to .NET Framework, to ensure stable system operation. Follow these steps:</p><ol><li><b>Open Command Prompt:</b><br/>Press <b>Windows + R</b> keys, type <code>cmd</code>, and then press <b>Enter</b>.</li><li><b>In the Command Prompt window, enter the following command:</b><br/><code style='background-color:#f0f0f0; padding: 2px 5px; border-radius:3px; font-family:monospace;'>sfc /scannow</code></li><li><b>Wait for the system to complete the file scan and repair process.</b></li><li><b>Restart your computer and check if Lets VPN can now run properly.</b></li></ol><img src='/assets/use-netfrenwork-en-6.png' alt='sfc /scannow command in CMD' /><h3>Method 3: Repairing the System Using Third-Party Security Software</h3><p>In Windows systems, third-party security tools can be utilized to detect and repair system issues, including potential problems with the .NET Framework.<br/>Taking 360 Total Security as an example, here's how to perform a system repair: (If you're using other tools, please refer to their respective help resources or contact their customer support for assistance.)</p><img src='/assets/use-netfrenwork-en-7.png' alt='Third-party security software system repair' /><p>If none of the above methods resolve the issue, please feel free to contact our online customer service in the bottom right corner.
